## Overview

Funnel chart widget is a graphical representation of data that uses a funnel-shaped diagram to display the progression of data through a series of Layers.
In SOC (Security Operations Center) analysis, a funnel chart widget can be used to represent the stages of a security incident response process. The chart can be used to visualize the progression of security incidents as they are identified, investigated, and resolved.

Using a funnel chart widget in SOC analysis can help analysts quickly identify trends and patterns in the security incident response process, and can help teams to better prioritize and allocate resources to resolve incidents more efficiently.
