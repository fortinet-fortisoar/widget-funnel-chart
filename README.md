## Overview

A funnel chart is a visualization tool that is used to represent a process where a large number of items or data points are gradually filtered down to a smaller number of items at each successive stage. 

In SOC (Security Operations Center) analysis, funnel charts are commonly used to visualize the various stages of the incident response process. The funnel chart widget is a useful tool for displaying data that moves through a series of stages or steps, with each step leading to the next. For example, the stages might include the detection of a threat, investigation and analysis, containment, and resolution.

Using the funnel chart widget in SOC analysis can help analysts quickly identify trends and patterns in the security incident response process, and can help teams to better prioritize and allocate resources to resolve incidents more efficiently.

In addition to incident response, the funnel chart widget can be used in various other domains such as sales and marketing to track the progress of leads through the sales funnel, and other contexts, such as website analytics or customer service. The stages in a funnel chart widget can be customized to reflect the specific process being analyzed.
