# Usage

The funnel chart widget provides a graphical representation of the number of alerts or incidents at each stage of the process. This information can be used to optimize the incident response process and improve overall efficiency.

In addition to incident response, the funnel chart widget can be used in various other domains such as sales and marketing to track the progress of leads through the sales funnel, and other contexts, such as website analytics or customer service. The stages in a funnel chart widget can be customized to reflect the specific process being analyzed.

## Funnel Chart Widget Edit View

This section details the process to edit the widget and use it with data from a specific record or from across multiple modules.

### Record containing JSON Data

This option helps retrieve and display data from a record that has values in `JSON` format. Select the **Record containing JSON Data** option if all data to be rendered is in a specific field of the module. The widget has filters to select only that record that meets the filter conditions.

1. Edit a module's (e.g. *Dashboard*) view template and select **Add Widget** button.

2. Select **Funnel Chart** from the list to bring up the **Funnel Chart** widget's customization modal.

3. Specify the title of the funnel chart in the **Title** field.

5. Select a module whose records contain `JSON` data. 

6. Define filters under the field **Filter Record Which Contains The JSON Data**. The filter conditions should be such that they select only the record that contains the relevant data.

7. Select the field (the field must be of type `JSON`).

    *Below is an example of the field's value*:
    
    ```JSON 
    {
        "tam": 1000,
        "actual": 500,
        "possible": 800,
        "bToC": {
            "sale": 200
        }
    }
    ```
8. Specify a **Title** for the layer **Layer 1**.

9. Specify the `JSON` *key* whose *value* is to be rendered in the **Value** field.

    > Consider the `JSON` data mentioned in the example. To render `actual` and `sale` data in two layers, populate the **Value** field as follows:
